# Bayesian Air Traffic Modeling

Welcome aboard BayesAir, a Bayesian framework for modeling and analyzing air transportation network dynamics! ðŸ›«âœ¨

## Overview

This repository contains a Bayesian model of air traffic network dynamics implemented as a probabilistic program in [Pyro](pyro.ai).

## Installation

TODO@dawsonc add installation instructions using poetry for dependency management

make sure you have poetry installed: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
and then run `poetry install` to install dependencies for this
then see here for basic usage: https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/
but you can just run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment

## Getting started

TODO@dawsonc add some getting started instructions linking to the notebook.

## other notes

see [here](https://github.com/jz268/atm_generative) for some of the data stuff, will merge eventually probably
