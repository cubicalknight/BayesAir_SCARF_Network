# Bayesian Air Traffic Modeling

Welcome aboard BayesAir, a Bayesian framework for modeling and analyzing air transportation network dynamics! ðŸ›«âœ¨

## Overview

This repository contains a Bayesian model of air traffic network dynamics implemented as a probabilistic program in [Pyro](pyro.ai).

## Installation

TODO@dawsonc add installation instructions using poetry for dependency management

## Getting started

TODO@dawsonc add some getting started instructions linking to the notebook.
